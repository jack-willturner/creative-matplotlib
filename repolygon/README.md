# repolygon

### Intricate tiling designs from *re*peated *polygon* *matplotlib* patches.

#### Core code & designs created by Sadie Bartholomew, June - October 2017 *

\*code tidied & project (initially) uploaded to *GitHub* May 2019

## Design Gallery

Eleven original example designs plus a recreation of, and variant on, the
iconic carpet from the Kubrick film 'The Shining'.


### Example designs shown in minimal tones

Emphasis here is on the geometrical form on the plane rather than the colour
scheme and motif, mainly to demonstrate the basic capability of the
``repolygon`` program:

### Example designs in full colour [in progress]

:heavy_exclamation_mark: **Note:** the logic for custom colouring of designs
is currently under refactor, so most of the designs (all except 10 & 11) are
shown with incomplete (but in some ways representative) colouring pending the
finalisation of that code. See the section below for impressions of the
colours that will be used after the refactor. :heavy_exclamation_mark:

These ~~are~~ [will be (see note above)] the final designs. For every case, the
individual colour scheme & mapping of it onto the set of intersecting polygons
(depicted in minimal tones in the section above) are considered an instrinsic
part of the overall design:

### Prototypes for the colouring of the final designs

These are the final designs as produced in minimal tones or outlines and then
coloured using fill tools in a graphics editor. They show what the final
designs will look like when the refactor of the colouring module is complete.

### Prototypes for the designs incorporating curved patches

These are prototypes for designs which incorporate custom patches using
[`matplotlib.path.Path`](https://matplotlib.org/api/path_api.html#matplotlib.path.Path),
which often make use of curved lines via Bezier curves to join points in the
patches (formed via `CURVE3` and `CURVE4` codes as described in the `Path`
object API reference as linked) together. These patches aren't strictly
polygons as per the project name, as the lines aren't all straight, but
this flexibility allows further very interesting designs to be made.

As in the above section, the outlines have been coded using `repolygon` but
the colours were, for now, added manually using an external graphcs editor.
