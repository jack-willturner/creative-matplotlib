# creative-matplotlib

## Assorted creative coding scripts & outputs using `matplotlib`

The creative coding scripts are **organised into projects or mini-projects
contained in a top-level directory** under this (repository) root directory.

A **detailed description with embedded outputs for each (mini-)project is
provided in the README of the corresponding sub-directory, also containing
all of the code with the output image files** arranged in a hierarchy.

Navigate to any sub-directory to:

* read through the README for a detailed account, and
* access the code and raw outputs for each (mini-)project.

A brief overview and status indication of each project (existing so far) are
also included below for quick reference. Note that new projects
will be added incrementally, so the list should grow, and existing projects
may be extended further in future, even if they are marked as 'complete' in
status (since while  a project may be complete in some sense, extensions or
developments to it may be perceived and/or actualised only at a later stage).


### [contours-on-gradient-backgrounds](contours-on-gradient-backgrounds)

Status: *completed*

Contour plots of products and/or quotients of trigonometric functions on
simple gradient backgrounds.


### [repolygon](repolygon)

Status: *partially completed*

Intricate tiling designs from repeated polygon matplotlib patches.


### [ellsworth-kelly-replications](ellsworth-kelly-replications)

Status: *completed*

Replication of, and variations on, selected artworks by Ellsworth Kelly.


### [julio-le-parc-replications](julio-le-parc-replications)

Status: *largely completed*

Replication of, and variations on, selected artworks by Julio Le Parc.


### [tree-profiles](tree-profiles)

Status: *early development stage*

Attempts to recreate the side profile of a range of common trees in their
bare (leafless) form.
